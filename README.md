# Hangman Game

A simple Hangman game implemented using Python and ASCII ART

## About

Console-based Hangman game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected word by guessing one letter at a time. The player has 6 lives and loses one for each incorrect guess. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Input validation for guesses (single letters, case-insensitive)
- Tracks and prevents repeated guesses
- Displays current progress and remaining lives
- Simple ASCII art to represent Hangman stages

## How to run

1 .Clone the repository or download the files  
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed  
3. Run the script  
Note: The word list and ASCII art are stored in separate modules (hangman_word_list.py and hangman_art.py).

## Possible Improvements

- Add input validation to prevent invalid guesses
- Handle full word guesses
- Add hints and difficulty levels
